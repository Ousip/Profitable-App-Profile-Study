# Profitable-App-Profile-Study

The project aims to develop an understanding of the profitable app profiles for App Store and Google Play Marketplaces. This is achieved thorugh identifying the types of apps that are likely to attract most users.

Note: Modules such as NumPy, Pandas, and Bokeh can be used to greatly improve the efficiency for some of the data cleaning and visualisation tasks performed in this notebook. They have been consciously excluded however to demonstrate the data analysis capability of the base Python package.
